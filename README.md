# My research area of interest is Artificial Intelligence (AI). Within AI, I am interested in problems related to probabilistic forecast, machine learning and HPC, and their interdisciplinary applications to earth  science. I have found the applications in earth sciences to be exciting not only because of their practical value, but also as an inspiration for new types of problems that prompt the development of new theories and algorithms that have not been investigated before. My research work blends both theoretical and practical aspects of problems .In the following, I first briefly summarize research work I conducted till year 2020. This work also includes my early career years as a Scientific officer at  Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune and then pursuing Integrated-M.Tech-PhD in Computer science and IT student at Department of Technology, Pune University . 
A. Current research Work : My research work during this period focused mostly on following areas: (1) climate model potential predictability of  ISMR and (2) machine learning & HPC Both of these areas were strongly influenced by earth sciences and engineering problems. This line of my research work focused on the development of climate science model: in this Machine learning Motivated by the emergence of large datasets in various areas of science, technology, business, and everyday life in the past decade, my second area of research work focused on machine learning that aim to improve the understanding of patterns in the data and processes that generate them, and utilize them in solving nontrivial and challenging problems such as prediction of Indian monsoon, and extreme event detection. My work spanned both the development of new machine learning algorithms, as well as, their interdisciplinary applications to earth sciences and engineering fields. Examples of my work in earth sciences include: (1)  ISMR prediction using Analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques in which I used the Signal to Noise Ratio,Mutual Information,entropy, RLimit for prediction, I used 5 month initial conditions for model simulations and found the February initial condition predict good correlation among the all different initial conditions. (M.Tech. Thesis and AGU JAMES paper 2017)(2) The development of the deep learning model using CNN for prediction of the Elnino, which is a climate phenomenon that occurs when a vast pool of water in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean becomes abnormally warm, which affect the extreme events in the world, for Indian perspective, causes drought .

B.  Working on High performance computing & Monsoon Mission project to improve the skill of Indian summer monsoon rainfall using climate forecast system T382L64 model, recently published paper on Potential predictability of ISMR In this Experiments are done with Coupled NCEP Climate Forecast System forced by SST persistence method and using different initial conditions/ensemble method (both observed and models) for prediction of the rainfall and wind circulation on annual to hourly time scale. Simulations have been done to study the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall pattern analysis.
New setup of Cray Supercomputer “Pratyush” a 4.5 Petaflop capacity & Benchmark the scientific applications.
# Implementing the ACE2 (AI2 Climate Emulator version 2) for Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) prediction involves creating a machine learning-based atmospheric emulator tailored to India's monsoon patterns. The ACE2 model, as described in the literature, is a 450M-parameter autoregressive emulator with 6-hour temporal resolution, 1° horizontal resolution, and eight vertical layers, designed to simulate atmospheric variability and conserve global dry air mass and moisture. It excels at capturing phenomena like tropical cyclones and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), which are critical for monsoon prediction. Below, I provide a comprehensive implementation plan, including code, leveraging the ACE2 framework for ISMR prediction, using Python with PyTorch, and incorporating ERA5 reanalysis data for training, as suggested by the source material. Since the full ACE2 codebase is complex and proprietary components may not be fully open-source, this implementation outlines a simplified version inspired by the ACE2 architecture, focusing on ISMR prediction.

## CorrDiff (Correction Diffusion) is a deep learning model developed to predict and correct the errors made by numerical weather models (e.g., NIM) during forecasting.
It learns to forecast the model error fields (differences between model outputs and observations/reanalysis) and applies corrections during runtime to improve forecasts without replacing the physics-based dynamics.
Key Idea:
Instead of predicting the weather directly (as in FourCastNet), CorrDiff predicts the error of the physics model and adds it back at each simulation step.
